											So I approached Shyamala for her assistance, who back then stayed in Chembur, which was close to my residence. She started teaching my elder son Math and science, who had just completed his 11th grade. Then seeing his improvement in performance, I also started sending my younger son to her, who had just gone in 10th standard. within a few days of her hard work, I could see the change, not only in their studies, but also their improved behavior towards their studies.
											My elder son is completed his BSC honors in software engineering, And now he would be traveling to Scotland to do his Masters in business and management and my younger son is in the third year of Bsc honors in software engineering.</p>

										<p>My name is Pratik Pasad and I am honored to have gotten this opportunity to write this testimonial.
											I would not be what I am without Shyamala Ma’am in my life. I was a timid, mildly dyslexic child with no self worth or confidence, no sense of goal or passion and I saw my life transform with a teacher that had a very unique way of bringing out my potential. What initially started as only academics soon became all round development for me. Whether it’s languages, math, sciences etc or etiquette, speech, civic responsibility, literally everything was taught by her. Her passion to transform her students lives is extraordinary. She went all out for me to ensure I excel in the fields I could do better in. She also made my curriculum fun and engaging. She’s been a very important part of my upbringing and I cannot be more thankful.
											Today I have a successful business of Luggage Bags and Travel Accessories in the US and I’m also a wealth manager. I genuinely hope all weak students like me get the Midas touch of Shyamala Ma’am.</p>

										<p>I first met Syamala Maam when I was 14 years old and she tutored me for 2 years during my 9th and 10th grade school years. However, tutoring doesn’t do justice to her work - I would say she works on overall academic, personal and mental development. Those 2 years were probably the most significant years of my teenage years and continue to influence me to this day. Syamala ma’am not only helped me academically (I passed my courses with flying years and was in the top 5 students of my school in 10th boards), she helped me become healthier both physically and mentally. I was going through a very tough time in my personal life and she showed me incredible kindness and I knew I could always count on her. Even today, I know she will help in any way she can if I approach her and in that way she continues to be my teacher/guru for life. I am currently a biological researcher at University of Southern California doing something I really love and feel that I am contributing to the society. I have navigated many rough times and taken some incredibly hard and courageous decisions to be at the point that I am today, and I believe that Syamala Maam’s teachings set the stage for me to pursue my ambitions and helped me throughout my journey. -

										<p>Being tutored by Syamala Ma'am during my early teens was a turning point in my academic journey. Her expertise in Science and Mathematics, coupled with her unique teaching methods, made learning enjoyable and effective. She not only imparted knowledge but also instilled in me a love for learning. Her encouragement and guidance helped me excel in my exams and laid the foundation for my future success. Today, as I reflect on my journey, I am grateful for her mentorship and influence in shaping not just my academic path but also my character. Working as a Vice President at J.P. Morgan, USA, I owe a great deal of my achievements to her. Syamala Ma'am will always be more than just a teacher to me; she is a role model and a source of inspiration.</p>
